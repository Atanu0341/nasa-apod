2025-12-22: Sunset Solstice over Stonehenge
![Sunset Solstice over Stonehenge](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2512/StonehengeSolstice_Dury_960.jpg)
Yesterday the Sun reached its southernmost point in planet Earth's sky.  Called a solstice, many cultures mark yesterday's date as a change of seasons -- from autumn to winter in Earth's Northern Hemisphere and from spring to summer in Earth's Southern Hemisphere.  The featured image was taken just before the longest night of the 2025 northern year at Stonehenge in United Kingdom. There, through stones precisely placed 4,500 years ago, a 4.5 billion year old large glowing orb is seen setting. Even given the precession of the Earth's rotational axis over the millennia, the Sun continues to set over Stonehenge in an astronomically significant way.
